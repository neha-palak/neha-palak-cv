    <h2>Problem 1: Portrait Perspective Distortion</h2>

    <img src="images/portrait_close.jpg" alt="Close-up portrait">
    <img src="images/portrait_zoom.jpg" alt="Zoomed portrait">

    <p>
      The first image was taken from very close to the subject, causing perspective
      distortion where facial features closer to the camera appear exaggerated.
      In the second image, the camera was placed farther away and zoomed in to
      maintain face size, which reduces perspective distortion and preserves
      natural facial proportions.

    <h2>Problem 2: Street Compression</h2>

    <img src="images/street_zoom.jpg" alt="Zoomed street">
    <img src="images/street_close.jpg" alt="Closer street view">

    <p>
      The zoomed-in image taken from far away appears flattened because perspective
      differences across depth are reduced. When the camera is moved closer,
      depth variation becomes more pronounced, making the scene appear less compressed.

    <h2>Problem 3: Perspective vs Orthographic Projection</h2>

    <img src="images/perspective.jpg" alt="Perspective projection">
    <img src="images/orthographic.jpg" alt="Orthographic-like projection">

    <p>
      The first image demonstrates perspective projection where parallel lines converge.
      The second image approximates orthographic projection by increasing camera distance
      and zooming in, causing parallel edges to remain parallel.
      Red lines highlight this difference.
