  <!-- Problem 1 Portrait Perspective Distortion-->
  <section>
    <h2>Problem 1:</h2>
    <div class="image-row">
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Q1_close.jpg" alt="Close-up portrait">
        <figcaption>Close-up image</figcaption>

    <p>
      In the first image, the photograph is taken from very close to the subject. Because the camera is near the face, parts of the face closer to the camera (such as the nose and mouth) appear disproportionately larger than parts farther away (such as the ears). This results in noticeable perspective distortion and an unnatural appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second image, the camera is placed farther away and zoomed in so that the face appears approximately the same size as in the first image. Increasing the camera-to-subject distance reduces the relative depth differences across facial features, thereby reducing perspective distortion. As a result, the facial proportions appear more natural and visually pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demonstrates that perspective distortion depends primarily on camera distance rather than zoom or focal length.

  <!-- Problem 2 Street Compression-->
  <section>
    <h2>Problem 2:</h2>
    <div class="image-row">
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Q2_close.jpg" alt="Closer street view">
        <figcaption>Close-up view of street</figcaption>

    <p>
      In the first image, the camera is positioned closer to the scene without significant zoom. This produces strong perspective effects: objects closer to the camera appear much larger than distant objects, and the depth of the scene is clearly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second image, the camera is placed farther away and zoomed in so that the scene occupies approximately the same image area. From this larger distance, the relative differences in depth between objects are reduced. As a result, the scene appears visually flattened, with distant objects appearing closer together in depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This effect occurs because increasing camera distance weakens perspective variation across the scene.

  <!-- Problem 3 Perspective vs Orthographic Projection-->
  <section>
    <h2>Problem 3: </h2>
    <div class="image-row">
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Q3_perspective.jpg" alt="Perspective projection">
        <figcaption>Image showing convergence</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <figure>

      </figure>
      
    </div>

    <p>
      The left image demonstrates perspective projection. The camera is placed relatively close to the scene, causing parallel lines (such as the edges of the floor and table) to converge as they extend farther from the camera. This convergence is a characteristic property of perspective projection and provides strong depth cues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right image approximates orthographic projection. The camera is positioned farther away and zoomed in to capture the same region of the scene. In this case, parallel edges remain nearly parallel, and depth-related scaling is significantly reduced. This suppresses perspective effects and makes the scene appear more geometrically uniform.
